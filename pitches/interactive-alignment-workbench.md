# Pitch: Interactive Alignment Workbench - TCGPlayer Analytics Enhancement

## Expiration
> Conditions for expiry of pitch
- User workflow patterns change significantly from current CLI-based analysis approach
- Core time series alignment system undergoes major architectural changes
- Business requirements shift from exploratory analysis to fully automated processing
- Team adopts different tooling stack that replaces current Python/CLI workflow

## Motivation
> Raw idea or anything that motivates this pitch
Current TCGPlayer price analysis requires frustrating trial-and-error experimentation to achieve optimal signature coverage. Users spend 15-30 minutes manually testing filter combinations like `--sets "SV*" --types "Card"` with binary success/failure feedback. When alignment fails, there's no guidance on why or how to improve results.

The existing robust 2-step alignment algorithm (find optimal start date → gap-fill missing signatures) works perfectly but provides no user insights during the discovery process. This creates workflow friction that reduces analytical productivity and prevents effective knowledge sharing across team members.

**Real Pain Point**: A user trying to analyze recent Pokemon card trends must manually experiment with different set patterns, getting empty DataFrames with no actionable feedback about coverage gaps or optimization opportunities.

## Appetite
> Appetite or time for shaping, building and cool-down. Measured in cups of coffee.

6 cups of coffee:
* 2 cups for shaping.
  * Map current user workflow pain points and design guided discovery interface.
  * Define coverage analytics specifications and configuration management approach.
* 3 cups for building.
  * Build guided filter discovery system with smart recommendations.
  * Implement coverage insight engine with actionable feedback.
  * Create configuration persistence and comparison capabilities.
* 1 cup for cool-down.
  * Integration testing with existing aggregation pipeline.
  * Documentation and user workflow validation.

## Core User-Friendly Solution
> Core elements of user-friendly solution.

**Interactive CLI Workbench** that transforms the current trial-and-error process into guided analysis:

1. **Guided Filter Discovery**:
```bash
$ python chart/alignment_workbench.py discover
🔍 Analyzing 1,437 records across 23 sets...
📊 Suggested configurations:
   1. SV* Cards: 100% coverage from 2025-04-28 (1,196 records)
   2. Premium Cards Mix: 95% coverage from 2025-04-20 (1,253 records)
   3. SWSH* Complete: 84% coverage from 2025-01-15 (241 records)
```

2. **Coverage Insight Engine**:
```bash
$ python chart/alignment_workbench.py analyze --sets "SV*" --types "Card"
📈 Coverage Analysis:
✅ Optimal start date: 2025-04-28 (13/13 signatures - 100%)
⚠️  57 early records will be excluded
💡 Alternative: --allow-fallback gives 99.2% coverage from 2025-04-20
```

3. **Configuration Management**:
```bash
$ python chart/alignment_workbench.py save --name "SV_cards_complete"
✅ Saved profile: 100% coverage, 13 signatures, 92 dates
$ python chart/alignment_workbench.py run SV_cards_complete
📊 Executing saved configuration...
```

**Technical Architecture**:
- Enhanced CLI using existing `typer` framework
- Coverage analytics module extending current `time_series_aligner.py` (no modifications)
- JSON configuration persistence via existing `FileHelper` patterns
- Seamless integration with `IndexAggregator` pipeline

## Potential Pitfalls of Core Solution
> Details about user-friendly solution with potential pitfalls or rabbit holes.

**UI/UX Complexity Risk**:
- **Problem**: CLI interface design can become overly complex with too many interactive prompts
- **Mitigation**: Stick to simple command patterns matching existing CLI conventions, limit interactive elements

**Performance Impact Risk**:
- **Problem**: Coverage analysis might slow down on large datasets when analyzing all possible filter combinations
- **Mitigation**: Implement smart sampling and caching, focus on most common filter patterns first

**Configuration Management Scope Creep**:
- **Problem**: Could expand into full workspace management system with version control, sharing features
- **Mitigation**: Limit to simple JSON file persistence, no cloud sync or collaboration features

**Integration Complexity**:
- **Problem**: Tight coupling with existing aggregation pipeline could require extensive modifications
- **Mitigation**: Design as wrapper layer that calls existing components unchanged, no core algorithm modifications

**Analysis Paralysis Risk**:
- **Problem**: Too much analytical detail could overwhelm users rather than guide them
- **Mitigation**: Progressive disclosure - show essential insights first, detailed diagnostics on request

## No-go or Limitations
> Any tasks that will be considered out of scope.

**Explicitly Out of Scope**:
- **Core Algorithm Changes**: No modifications to `time_series_aligner.py` 2-step alignment process
- **Web Interface**: CLI-only enhancement, no browser-based UI development
- **Machine Learning**: Rule-based recommendations only, no ML-powered suggestions
- **Performance Optimization**: No changes to existing HTTP rate limiting or concurrent processing
- **New Data Sources**: Works only with current TCGPlayer CSV schema, no external integrations
- **Advanced Visualization**: Text-based output only, no charts or graphs
- **Cloud Features**: Local-only configuration management, no remote storage or sharing
- **Workflow Automation**: No scheduled runs or automated configuration application

**Clear Boundaries**:
- Enhancement works within existing Python/CLI ecosystem
- Leverages current robust alignment foundation without modification
- Focuses purely on user experience improvement, not algorithmic advancement
- Maintains backward compatibility with all existing workflows and scripts
